                        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire,
                        wind,
                        water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
                        life
                        itself.
                        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                        This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
                        explore.
                        Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come
                        to
                        life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone
                        home).

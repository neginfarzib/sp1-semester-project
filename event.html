            <div>
                <p>
                    On loan from the Nemo Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the
                    Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power
                    of the elements az we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows
                    how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.

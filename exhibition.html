            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’ , explores the night
            sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
            stars to travel by.

                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
                        origins. Where
                        do
                        we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed the theory of evolution we have had
                        a
                        framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time.
                        You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
                        Wooly
                        Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h4>Biology and Medicine</h4>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us
                    unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.

                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks
                    to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                    medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                    first heart transplant.

                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                    animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                        the
                        future, From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.

                        the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not
                        just for humans but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
                        dangers we currently face including global warming, But we also focus the positive ways we can
                        all contribute to a brighter future. </p>
